# MaxBettiNumbers
## Macaulay2 package

[Documentation page for this package](https://jaywhite2357.github.io/MaxBettiNumbers/index.html)

The package can be found in the top directory, [here (MaxBettiNumbers.m2)](https://jaywhite2357.github.io/MaxBettiNumbers/MaxBettiNumbers.m2), or on the documentation page above.

Note: the file MaxBettiNumbers.m2 in the top directory is the completed package. The folder docs/ is so that the documentation is easily viewable via a webpage.

The folder SeparateFiles is what I use to develop the package. The python script M2expand.py removes all `load "file.m2"` commands and replaces them with the file.
This essentially compiles the SeparateFiles directory into the completed package.

There are several scripts that automate doing this as well as copying the documentation to the docs/ folder.
